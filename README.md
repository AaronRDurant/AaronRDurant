### Hey, I'm Aaron 👋🏻

I'm a front-end web developer, avid stationary cyclist, and wannabe writer currently living near Oxford, Michigan. In between daydreaming (and regular dreaming) about racing motocross, I'm excitedly working on a few projects while preparing for my first full-time developer role.
