# Aaron Durant

**Frontend engineer focused on clarity, speed, and thoughtful product design.**  
I build interfaces that make complex systems feel simple — with an emphasis on React, Next.js, and clean, maintainable architecture.

## Current Work
- **Lucid Suspension** — Building a modern web platform for a premium dirt bike suspension service, including a customer portal for service history, job status, and streamlined intake workflows.
- **Table Over Two** — Refining the frontend and publishing system for a Next.js + Ghost CMS publication ahead of the 2026 Supercross season.
- **Personal Site** — Migrating from Gatsby to a leaner, faster Next.js architecture.

## What I Do
- Design and develop frontend systems with clear UX, predictable data flows, and accessible interfaces.
- Own product surfaces end to end: from problem definition and UX structure to implementation, testing, and iteration.
- Blend engineering and editorial thinking to simplify complexity and communicate ideas clearly.

## How I Think
- Clarity is the foundation of effective UX.  
- Fast systems come from deliberate architecture, not clever hacks.  
- Details matter — in interfaces, writing, and racing.  
- Simplicity scales.

## Interests
Motorsports, endurance training, and continuous improvement — influences that shape how I approach engineering, decision-making, and iteration.
