### 👋🏻 Howdy, I'm Aaron.

I'm a software developer, motocross racer, and writer in Michigan. I work on minimum advertised price (MAP) monitoring software at my day job. Beyond that, I'm writing about professional Supercross and motocross at [MotoOnline](https://www.motoonline.com) and making the most of my first full motocross season in 15 years.
