### 👋🏻 Hey, I'm Aaron.

👨🏻‍💻 I'm a software developer with a five-year motorsports journalism background.

🛠 I'm proficient with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Gatsby, Next.js, Node.js, Git, and more.

🤔 Currently, I'm focused on learning MySQL, PHP, regex, and more, but I'm always aiming to improve all around!

💪🏻 My strengths include communication, problem-solving, ultra-clean code, project management, content strategy, and writing.

🏎 I attended three dozen motorsports events around North America and published nearly 2,000 articles about racing between 2015 and 2020 while maintaining a website I co-founded called [The Apex](https://www.theapex.racing).

📝 Though I transitioned to focusing full-time on web development, my affinity for the intersection of web design and content remains. I look forward to connecting these more as my career progresses.

⛳️ In my free time, I enjoy playing golf, biking, weight training, playing drums, and reading.
