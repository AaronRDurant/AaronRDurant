### 👋🏻 Howdy, I'm Aaron.

I'm a software developer, motocross racer, and writer in Michigan. I work on Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) monitoring software at my day job. Beyond that, I'm training for the 2023 motocross season and writing about professional Supercross and motocross at [MotoOnline](https://www.motoonline.com).
