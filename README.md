# Aaron Durant

I'm a front-end engineer who cares about clarity, performance, and thoughtful UX.

I co-founded The Apex, a motorsports publication that taught me content systems and UX at scale. I built Table Over Two, an analysis-driven Supercross and motocross publication on a custom Next.js + Ghost stack that's earned Supercross media accreditation. Now I'm building Lucid Suspension, a dirt bike suspension service and web platform centered on a clear, modern customer experience.

Same throughline: I make complex information simple and usable.
